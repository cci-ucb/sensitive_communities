# Sensitive Communities Data

This folder holds data needed to produce the sensitive community maps as well as the final outputs in both `.csv` and `.shp` formats. Use the `tier1` field to determine which tracts are considered to have `Heightened Sensitivity` and the `tier2` field to determine which tracts are just `Vulnerable`.  

## Data download

The maps underlying data can be downloaded here either as a csv ([`final_df.csv`](https://github.com/cci-ucb/sensitive_communities/blob/master/data/final_df.csv)) or as a shapefile by downloading all the associated `.shp` files including: 

[final_df.dbf](https://github.com/cci-ucb/sensitive_communities/blob/master/data/final_df.dbf)  
[final_df.prj](https://github.com/cci-ucb/sensitive_communities/blob/master/data/final_df.prj)  
[final_df.shp](https://github.com/cci-ucb/sensitive_communities/blob/master/data/final_df.shp)  
[final_df.shx](https://github.com/cci-ucb/sensitive_communities/blob/master/data/final_df.shx)
