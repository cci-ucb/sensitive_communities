# Sensitive Communities Data

This folder holds data needed to produce the sensitive community maps as well as the final outputs in both `.csv` and `.shp` formats. Use the `tier1` field to determine which tracts are considered to have `Heightened Sensitivity` and the `tier2` field to determine which tracts are just `Vulnerable`.
