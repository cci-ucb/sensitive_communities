## Overview

This repository holds all the code needed to produce the [Sensitive Communities maps](https://sensitivecommunities.org). We provide this code so that you may be able to replicate this work in your own state/city. 

Any modified code that is taken from this repo and not reviewed by the Urban Displacement Project is not endorsed by us and should be documented accordingly as not endorsed by the Urban Displacement Project. 

## Code & Usage

To run the code, fork this repository and navigate to the `code/data.r` file. You will also need to clone a copy of Tim Thomas' [Neighborhood Typology Function](https://gitlab.com/timathomas/Functions/blob/master/NeighType_Fun.R) to run the neighborhood racial typologies portion. 

You can also see the final dataframe (`final_df.csv`) and shpaefile (`final_df.shp`)in the `data` directory.
