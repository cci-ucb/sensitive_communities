## Overview

This repository holds all the code necessary for the [Sensitive Communities maps](https://sensitivecommunities.org). We provide this code so that you may be able to replicate this work in your own state/city. 

## Code & Usage

To run the code, fork this repository and navigate to the `code/data.r` file. You will also need to clone a copy of Tim Thomas' [Neighborhood Typology Function](https://gitlab.com/timathomas/Functions/blob/master/NeighType_Fun.R) to run the neighborhood racial typologies portion.
